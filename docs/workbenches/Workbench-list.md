# Workbenches

FreeCAD, like many modern design applications such as [Revit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revit) or [CATIA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CATIA), is based on the concept of [Workbench](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workbench). A workbench can be considered as a set of tools specially grouped for a certain task. In a traditional furniture workshop, you would have a work table for the person who works with wood, another one for the one who works with metal pieces, and maybe a third one for the guy who mounts all the pieces together.

In FreeCAD, the same concept applies. Tools are grouped into workbenches according to the tasks they are related to.

When you switch from one workbench to another, the tools available on the interface change. Toolbars, command bars and possibly other parts of the interface switch to the new workbench, but the contents of your scene doesn't change. You could, for example, start drawing 2D shapes with the Draft Workbench, then work further on them with the Part Workbench.

Note that sometimes a Workbench is referred to as a Module. However, Workbenches and Modules are different entities. A Module is any extension of FreeCAD, while a Workbench is a special type of Module with a GUI configuration (toolbars and menus).

## Built-in workbenches

The following workbenches are no longer included after version 0.20:

* ![image](https://github.com/gauriimaheshwarii/FreeCAD-documentation/assets/100439627/f7332799-41a3-4e1c-b0cf-8f36162fb52a) The [Drawing Workbench](https://wiki.freecad.org/Drawing_Workbench) was used for producing technical drawings. The [TechDraw Workbench](https://wiki.freecad.org/TechDraw_Workbench) is its more advanced replacement.
* ![image](https://github.com/gauriimaheshwarii/FreeCAD-documentation/assets/100439627/c822d08d-0fa3-4d78-872c-9ea127ab3c5f) The [Image Workbench](https://wiki.freecad.org/Image_Workbench) was used for working with bitmap images. It functionality has been integrated in [Std Base](https://wiki.freecad.org/Std_Base). See [Std Import](https://wiki.freecad.org/Std_Import) and [Std ViewLoadImage](https://wiki.freecad.org/Std_ViewLoadImage).
* ![image](https://github.com/gauriimaheshwarii/FreeCAD-documentation/assets/100439627/e0f3dc95-6648-4037-9f45-86ec7abc49f0) The [Raytracing Workbench](https://wiki.freecad.org/Raytracing_Workbench) was used for ray-tracing (rendering). The external [Render Workbench](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-render) should be used instead.

## External workbenches

FreeCAD workbenches are easy to program in [Python](https://wiki.freecad.org/Python), there are therefore many people developing additional workbenches outside of the FreeCAD main development area.

The [external workbenches](https://wiki.freecad.org/External_workbenches) page lists all that are known to this community. Most are easily installable from within FreeCAD, using the [Addon Manager](https://wiki.freecad.org/Std_AddonMgr), found under menu **Tools â†’ ![image](https://github.com/gauriimaheshwarii/FreeCAD-documentation/assets/100439627/aa8fe13f-e0e6-4cd3-ab47-b6c921c7f764) Addon manager**.
