# External workbenches

## Introduction

**External workbenches** are those created by power users which haven't been integrated into the main FreeCAD source code.

These workbenches aren't supported by the core FreeCAD development team, so they aren't tested to work with every version of FreeCAD. Questions, bug reports, and improvement requests should be made directly to the authors of the workbench.

Workbenches marked with AddonManager.svg can be installed from the Addon Manager. For manual installation see Installing more workbenches. If there are specific instructions or prerequisites for using an external workbench, then these should be noted on the workbench's home page.

Workbenches marked with Edit Cancel.svg are not recommended for recent versions of FreeCAD. They are obsolete, unmaintained, superseded by a newer workbench, or maybe they don't work with Python 3 or with Qt5. In most cases they should be avoided.
