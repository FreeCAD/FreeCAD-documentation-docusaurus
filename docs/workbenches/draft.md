# Draft Workbench

## Introduction

The ![DraftWorkbench](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-documentation-docusaurus/blob/main/src/assets/workbenches/draft/DraftWorkbench.svg) Draft Workbench is primarily focused on the creation and modification of 2D objects in FreeCAD. But it is not restricted to the XY plane of the global coordinate system. Its objects can have any orientation and position in 3D space, and some Draft objects can either be planar or non-planar.

Draft objects can be used for general drafting, similar to what can be done with Inkscape or AutoCAD. But they can also form the base for the creation of 3D objects in other workbenches. A Draft Wire may define the path of an Arch Wall, a Draft Polygon can be extruded with Part Extrude, etc. Many of the Draft modifier tools can be applied to 2D and 3D objects created with other workbenches as well. You can, for example, move a Sketch or create a Draft OrthoArray from a Part object.

The Draft Workbench also provides tools to define a working plane, a grid, and a snapping system to precisely control the position of geometry.

If your primary goal is the production of complex 2D drawings and DXF files, and you don't need 3D modelling, FreeCAD may not be the right choice for you. You may wish to consider a dedicated software program for technical drafting instead, such as LibreCAD or QCad.

## Preferences

![Preferences-draft](../assets/Preferences-draft.svg) [Preferences](https://wiki.freecad.org/Draft_Preferences): general preferences for the Draft Workbench.  
![Preferences-import-export](../assets/Preferences-import-export.svg) [Import Export Preferences](https://wiki.freecad.org/Import_Export_Preferences): preferences available for importing from and exporting to different file formats.

## File formats

The Draft Workbench provides FreeCAD with importers and exporters for several file formats. These are used by the [Std Import](https://wiki.freecad.org/Std_Import) and [Std Export](https://wiki.freecad.org/Std_Import) commands.

- [Autodesk .DXF](https://wiki.freecad.org/Draft_DXF): imports and exports [Drawing Exchange Format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoCAD_DXF) files. See also [FreeCAD and DXF Import](https://wiki.freecad.org/FreeCAD_and_DXF_Import).
- [Autodesk .DWG](https://wiki.freecad.org/Draft_DXF): imports and exports DWG files via an external DWG converter. See also [FreeCAD and DWG Import](https://wiki.freecad.org/Draft_DXF).
- [Scalable Vector Graphics .SVG](https://wiki.freecad.org/Draft_SVG): imports and exports [Scalable Vector Graphics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) files.
- [Open Cad format .OCA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics): imports and exports [OCA/GCAD](http://groups.google.com/group/open_cad_format) files.
- [Airfoil Data Format .DAT](https://wiki.freecad.org/Draft_DAT): imports DAT files describing Airfoil profiles.

## Unit tests

See also: [Test Workbench](https://wiki.freecad.org/Testing).

To run the unit tests of the workbench execute the following from the operating system terminal:

```python
freecad -t TestDraft
```

## Scripting

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/) and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](https://wiki.freecad.org/FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics).

The workbench includes a module to create samples of all objects in a new document.

Use this to test that all objects are produced correctly:

```python
import drafttests.draft_test_objects as dto
doc = dto.create_test_file()
```

Inspecting the code of this module can help to understand the programming interface.
