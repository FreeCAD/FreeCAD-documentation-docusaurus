# Arch Workbench

## Introduction

The ![arch-workbench](./assets/workbench-arch.png) Arch Workbench provides a modern [**B**uilding **I**nformation **M**odelling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_Information_Modeling) (BIM) workflow to FreeCAD, with support for features like fully parametric architectural entities such as walls, beams, roofs, windows, stairs, pipes, and furniture. It supports [**I**ndustry **F**oundation **C**lasses] (IFC) files, and production of 2D floor plans in combination with the Workbench TechDraw.svg TechDraw Workbench.

The Arch Workbench imports all tools from the Workbench Draft.svg Draft Workbench, as it uses its 2D objects to build 3D parametric architectural objects. Nevertheless, Arch can also use solid shapes created with other workbenches like Workbench Part.svg Part and Workbench PartDesign.svg PartDesign.

The BIM functionality of FreeCAD is now progressively split into this Arch Workbench, which holds basic architectural tools, and the Workbench BIM.svg BIM Workbench, which is available from the Std AddonMgr.svg Addon Manager. This BIM Workbench adds a new interface layer on top of the Arch tools, with the aim of making the BIM workflow more intuitive and user-friendly. See FreeCAD BIM migration guide.

The developers of Draft, Arch, and BIM also collaborate with the greater OSArch community, with the ultimate goal of improving building design by using entirely free software.
