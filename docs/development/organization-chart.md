# Organization chart

## Introduction

FreeCAD is a community project, created and maintained by individuals motivated mainly by their wish to create a powerful, free, and open-source CAD platform. There is currently no formal association or organization behind the FreeCAD project. Decisions are usually taken by consensus, but more generally, thanks to the very modular nature of FreeCAD, anyone is free to work in the direction they find best. Anybody is always welcome to [participate and help the project](https://wiki.freecad.org/Help_FreeCAD), and participate to the community that gathers on the [forum](https://forum.freecadweb.org/) provided they respect the [code of conduct](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Governance

The general management of FreeCAD is organized by the **FreeCAD administrators**: jriegel, wmayer, yorik, kkremitzki, jmaustpc. Code contributions to FreeCAD are managed by the administrators plus a team of **core developers**: bernd, chrisb, sliptonic, abdullah, sgrogan, wandererfan, ickby, DeepSOIC. Anyone is [welcome to help the reviewing process](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=46574). [Moderators](https://forum.freecadweb.org/memberlist.php?mode=team) take care of most other aspects of the project and maintain the community in shape.
