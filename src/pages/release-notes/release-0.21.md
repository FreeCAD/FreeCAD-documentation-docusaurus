[Pull request #9668](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/9668)

## User interface

- The [Navigation Cube](https://wiki.freecad.org/Navigation_Cube) has been updated. The cube is no longer shown in perspective if the [3D view](https://wiki.freecad.org/3D_view) is in orthographic view mode. Corner faces have been made hexagonal and larger so that they are easier to click. Borders have been added around the buttons. Default font selection and sizing have been improved.  
The Mini-cube menu now includes a checkbox to toggle the movability of the cube. Several new parameters have been added.    
See the [Navigation Cube](https://wiki.freecad.org/Navigation_Cube) page for more information.

- Added a "developer mode" to aid in the creation of the metadata file required in each Addon.  

## Arch Workbench

- Several [Arch Profile](https://wiki.freecad.org/Arch_Profile) categories have been added: IS RHS, IS SHS, IS Angle and IS Tee.    
Pull request #7181](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7181) and [pull request #7217](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7217)
- [Arch Profile](https://wiki.freecad.org/Arch_Profile) objects now support modification of the profile type after creation.  
[Pull request #7217](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7217)
- Several edit mode issues have been fixed, and the [Tree view](https://wiki.freecad.org/Tree_view) context menus for Arch objects have been improved. Objects that can be edited now have an **Edit** option in that menu.  
The **Set colors** option was removed for objects without a face, or that can only have a single face.  
[Pull request #8122](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8122)
- [Arch SectionPlane](https://wiki.freecad.org/Arch_SectionPlane) objects now handle non-solid objects the same as solid objects.  
[Pull request #8688](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8688)

### Further Arch improvements

[Pull request #8409](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8409)

## Draft Workbench

- The inaccuracy of [Draft Snap Near](https://wiki.freecad.org/Draft_Snap_Near) when snapping to curves was fixed. In addition, [Draft Snap Perpendicular](https://wiki.freecad.org/Draft_Snap_Perpendicular) can now also snap to faces and find multiple points.  
To snap to a vertex (e.g. a [Draft Point](https://wiki.freecad.org/Draft_Point)) [Draft Snap Endpoint](https://wiki.freecad.org/Draft_Snap_Endpoint) must now be used instead of [Draft Snap Near](https://wiki.freecad.org/Draft_Snap_Near).  
[Pull request #7132](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7132)


- To make working with [layers](https://wiki.freecad.org/Draft_Layer) easier, their drag and drop behavior was modified. If you drop an object from a [Std Group](https://wiki.freecad.org/Std_Group) or a group-like object such as an [Arch BuildingPart](https://wiki.freecad.org/Arch_BuildingPart), on a layer, it is no longer removed from the group, and vice versa.  
This works without holding down the `Ctrl` key.  
[Pull request #7462](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7462)

- The [Draft PointArray](https://wiki.freecad.org/Draft_PointArray) command now supports more point object types. Any object with a shape and vertices, as well as a [mesh](https://wiki.freecad.org/Mesh_Workbench) and a [point cloud](https://wiki.freecad.org/Points_Workbench) can be used.  
[Pull request #7597](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7597)

- The [Tree view](https://wiki.freecad.org/Tree_view) context menus for Draft objects have been improved. Objects that can be edited with the [Draft Edit](https://wiki.freecad.org/Draft_Edit) command, or that have a dedicated edit solution, now have an **Edit** option in that menu. The **Set colors** option was removed for objects without a face, or that can only have a single face.  
[Pull request #7970](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7970)

- The properties of Draft annotation objects have been unified. [Draft Text](https://wiki.freecad.org/Draft_Text), [Draft Dimension](https://wiki.freecad.org/Draft_Dimension) and [Draft Label](https://wiki.freecad.org/Draft_Label) objects now all have a Font Name, a Font Size and a Text Color property.  
The Display Mode options have also been made consistent and are now: **Screen** and **World**.  
[Issue #7861](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/7861) and [pull request #8081](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8081)

- In the task panel of the [Draft SetStyle](https://wiki.freecad.org/Draft_SetStyle) command the **Texts/dims** button has been replaced by the **Annotations** button. Pressing this button will process all annotations, including [Draft Labels](https://wiki.freecad.org/Draft_Label). **Dim overshoot**, **Ext lines** and **Ext overshoot** parameters have been added.  
Several minor additional issues were also fixed.  
[Pull request #8190](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8190), [pull request #8195](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8195), [pull request #8196](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8196), and [pull request #9514](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/9514)

For B-splines and BÃ©zier curves, a Reverse option has also been added to the same menu.    
The task panels have been cleaned up.   
[Pull request #7527](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7527) and [pull request #7541](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7541)

- Using Esc to exit a command no longer switches off continue mode.  
[Pull request #7611](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7611)

- The [Draft Snap](https://wiki.freecad.org/Draft_Snap) toolbar was changed to a standard toolbar. Keyboard shortcuts can now be assigned to snaps. But using them during a command only works if none of the input boxes in the task panel has the focus as they 'catch' the so-called in-command shortcuts.  
[Pull request #7656](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7656)

- Several [Draft AnnotationStyleEditor](https://wiki.freecad.org/Draft_AnnotationStyleEditor) bugs have been fixed. The parameters of the **Text color** and **Text spacing** have been added.

It is now also possible to specify a velocity via a math formula (to define a velocity profile).  
[Pull request #8963](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8963) and [pull request #8964](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8964)  
> **Note**: This is a breaking change. Analyses with existing flow velocity and initial flow velocity constraints will not work anymore. You have to create new flow velocity constraints in the analysis to make existing analyses work.
> **Also note**: until FreeCAD 0.21, the results of the flow solver were wrong (fluid density and viscosity were a factor of 1000 too high). Therefore, the necessary recreation of the velocity constraint also assures the results will be correct.

- It is now possible to define in the ![image](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-documentation-docusaurus/assets/100439627/d1361b01-5b3c-4310-875b-9424a6d2922c) [displacement constraint](https://wiki.freecad.org/FEM_ConstraintDisplacement) displacements as equations (displacement according to the current solver time).

[Forum thread](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=71936) and [pull request #7715](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7715)

- The [preferences](https://wiki.freecad.org/FEM_Preferences) have a new option to define which solver should automatically be added when creating a new analysis.

- Usability improvements:
  - If you are in the FEM workbench when loading a FreeCAD file containing an analysis, the analysis gets activated automatically (you have immediate access to all FEM toolbar buttons).
  - The toolbar only has buttons for solvers installed on your system. Unavailable solvers are no longer displayed.

- New example files for the following equations are available via the [FEM Examples](https://wiki.freecad.org/FEM_Examples): [Deformation](https://wiki.freecad.org/FEM_EquationDeformation), [Flow](https://wiki.freecad.org/FEM_EquationFlow), [Flux](https://wiki.freecad.org/FEM_EquationFlux), [Heat](https://wiki.freecad.org/FEM_EquationHeat), [Magnetodynamic](https://wiki.freecad.org/FEM_EquationMagnetodynamic) and [Magnetodynamic 2D](https://wiki.freecad.org/FEM_EquationMagnetodynamic2D).

### Further PartDesign improvements

- In the [Hole](https://wiki.freecad.org/PartDesign_Hole) dialog, the deprecated screw head types (cheese head, cap screw, etc.) have been removed. They were deprecated since FreeCAD 0.19.  
Holes using these types are transformed into custom countersinks/counterbore holes with the diameter and depth used by the types.  
[Pull request #7654](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7654)

- In the [Additive Loft](https://wiki.freecad.org/PartDesign_AdditiveLoft) and [Subtractive Loft](https://wiki.freecad.org/PartDesign_SubtractiveLoft) dialogs, the previously non-functional option **Closed** does now create a closed loft (like a ring).  
[Pull request #8748](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8748)

- The [Validate sketch](https://wiki.freecad.org/Sketcher_ValidateSketch) command was added to Helper toolbar.  
[Pull request #7700](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7700)

- The unusable [Leave sketch](https://wiki.freecad.org/Sketcher_LeaveSketch) and [View sketch](https://wiki.freecad.org/Sketcher_ViewSketch) commands were removed from the menu.  
The [Edit sketch](https://wiki.freecad.org/Sketcher_EditSketch), [Merge sketches](https://wiki.freecad.org/Sketcher_MergeSketches) and [Mirror sketch](https://wiki.freecad.org/Sketcher_MirrorSketch) commands were added to the menu.  
[Pull request #7700](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7700)

- The [involute gear profile](https://wiki.freecad.org/PartDesign_InvoluteGear) has new properties to change the tooth length. This now allows adjustments for certain types of interferences and to use the profile to create [involute splines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_(mechanical)) too.    
[Pull request #8184](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8184)

- The [involute gear profile](https://wiki.freecad.org/PartDesign_InvoluteGear) now offers profile shifting.

[Pull request #9547](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/9547)

## Path Workbench

- **Camotics integration**: If Camotics (version 1.2.2 or later) is installed, a new icon will be added to the Path toolbar.  
Select a Path Job and press the button to open the Camotics dialog. Then, drag the slider to generate a simulated solid at any point in the job. You can also launch the full camotics application to run the animated simulation. This results in a silent post-processing of the job and the creation of a camotics project file.  
[Pull request #6637](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/6637)

- **Additional substitution strings for automatic output naming**: If the output is being split into multiple files, the filenames can automatically substitute the tool controller label, Work Coordinate Systems (WCS), or operation label.  
This is in addition to the other existing substitution strings like date, job name, etc.

- Implemented Chipbreaking option for peck-style drill cycles. Chip breaking emits a G73 cycle, which causes the control to make a very small retraction move to break the chip without fully retracting the bit from the hole. G73 is supported natively by LinuxCNC.  
Some other postprocessors will have to interpret the G73 and emit control-appropriate codes or decompose the retraction into G1/G0 moves.  
Postprocessor support for G73 decomposition has been added to the "refactored" postprocessors.  
[Pull request #7469](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7469)

The Sketcher toolbars that are only for edit mode are hidden in non-edit mode, and those only for non-edit mode are hidden in edit mode.  
The Structure toolbar is also hidden in Sketcher.  
[Pull request #7655](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7655)
- [Carbon copy](https://wiki.freecad.org/Sketcher_CarbonCopy) if possible, now uses constraint names in the expressions it creates instead of an index-based reference, making it more reliable.  
[Pull request #7688](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7688)

- The [SurfaceFinishSymbol](https://wiki.freecad.org/TechDraw_SurfaceFinishSymbol) tool was added to allow for the creation of surface finish symbols describing roughness, lay, and waviness, but also denoting the type of surface treatment.    
It supports both ISO and ASME styles.  
As shown in the image, the existing [LeaderLine](https://wiki.freecad.org/TechDraw_LeaderLine) tool can be used to properly refer oriented symbols to the edges of an object.

[Pull request #9280](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/9280)

## Compilation

Since this release, FreeCAD can only be compiled using Qt 5.x and Python 3.x. The lowest-supported Qt version is 5.12, and the lowest-supported Python version is 3.8.

To compile FreeCAD, see the instructions for [Windows](https://wiki.freecad.org/Compile_on_Windows), [Linux](https://wiki.freecad.org/Compile_on_Linux), and [macOS](https://wiki.freecad.org/Compile_on_MacOS).

The supported operating systems are:
- Windows 7, 8, 10 and 11
- Linux Ubuntu Focal Fossa (20.04) and newer
- macOS: 10.12 Sierra or newer

## Known Limitations

### 32bit Windows

Since FreeCAD 0.19, we no longer officially support 32-bit Windows. FreeCAD might work on these systems, but no support is given.

### Remote Desktop under Windows

Depending on the OpenGL graphics capabilities of a computer, it might be that one encounters a crash when running FreeCAD via a remote desktop. To fix this, upgrade your OpenGL driver. Only if this doesn't help:
- Download [this](https://downloads.fdossena.com/geth.php?r=mesa64-latest) OpenGL library for 64bit Windows and extract it.
- Rename the DLL file to _opengl32sw.dll_ and copy it to the _bin_ subfolder of FreeCAD's installation folder (overwrite the existing DLL there).

### macOS: Start Workbench shows a blank page

If the [Start Workbench](https://wiki.freecad.org/Start_Workbench) shows only a blank page, you must enable the option **Use software OpenGL** in the menu **FreeCAD-0.21 â†’ Preferences â†’ Display**.
